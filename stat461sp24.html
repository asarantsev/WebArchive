<p><strong>Classroom:</strong> AB 206</p>
<p><strong>Date &amp; Time:</strong> MW 13:00-14:15</p>
<p><strong>Office Hours: </strong>MTW 10:00-12:00, T 13:00-15:00, or by appointment</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong><span>MATH 283 (Calculus III) with a C or better</span></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>It is the student's responsibility to know calculus (differential, integral, and multivariate). 
 The fact that a student has taken calculus classes a long time ago is not considered an excuse. We will review 
 calculus only on the first lecture. If a student finds that a refresher is needed, this student can come to my office hours, 
 and I will suggest some review content. In this case, it is the student's responsibility to complete this review. 
 After the first lecture, I will assume by default that all students know calculus. 
 A student struggling with this calculus content will certainly struggle in this class.Â

<p><strong>Assessments:</strong> There are 12 homework assignments and 12 quizzes. Each homework must be submitted in person, written or typed on paper, NOT via Web Campus. Each quiz is 15 minutes at the end of the lecture, two problems. No cheat sheet, closed book, only calculator is OK. The midterm (March 20) is 5 problems, and the final exam (May 13, 8:00-10:00) is 10 problems, can use two-sided handwritten letter-size cheat sheet and a calculator. Any calculator model is OK.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Grading:</strong> Each quiz is 2%, each homework is 3%, the midterm is 15%, and the final exam is 30%. You can drop the lowest quiz and the lowest HW. Class letter grade is given by: <span>A 93%, A- 90%, B+ 85%, B 80%, B- 75%, C 70%, D 60%, F otherwise. The score is NOT rounded (89.9% means B+ not A-). Do NOT ask me to give you a certain grade because you need it for a job, scholarship, enrollment or other reasons. Such requests will be rejected. No exceptions or special considerations will be given. I do not give need-based grades.</span></p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Letters:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span>If you receive an A or A-, I can write you a strong and supportive letter of recommendation to a graduate or professional program of your choice. For such a letter to an industry job or internship (that is, outside a university or college), you must receive a C or above.&nbsp;</p>
