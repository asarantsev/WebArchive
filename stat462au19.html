</ul>
<h3>Office Hours</h3>
<p>Mon, Tue, Wed 1400-1700, in my office, or by appointment. <span>Before the midterms and the final exam, 
additional office hours will be announced.</span></p>
<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p>Emanuel Parzen <i>Stochastic Processes</i> (2015). You might also find useful my 
<a href = "./notes.pdf"> Lecture Notes</a> (sections 11-20)</p>
<h3>Student Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Demonstrate understanding of the probability foundations for stochastic processes through proofs and examples.</span></li>
<li><span>Build and use stochastic processes, including random walks, Markov chains, branching processes, Poisson and renewal processes.</span></li>
<li><span>Build and use continuous time stochastic process to model real-world phenomena.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Syllabus</h3>
<p><span>Discrete and continuous time stochastic processes with applications to actuarial and financial mathematics. 
Topics include: discrete-time Markov chains, random walk, branching processes, Poisson process, birth-and-death processes, renewal processes, 
continuous-time Markov chains, Brownian motion and stochastic calculus.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>
<p>There are 10 homework assignments due on Wednesdays 2300. Submission is online, via Web Campus. You can scan or take a photo of your work 
and upload it on Web Campus. Alternatively, you can type it in Word or LaTeX. This homework will be posted to Web Campus at least a week in advance, 
and graded by a homework grader inside Web Campus.</p>
<h3>Exams</h3>
<p>There are 3 midterms, each on Friday lecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Midterm 1: September 27</li>
<li>Midterm 2: November 1</li>
<li>Midterm 3: December 6</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not satisfied with your overall grade, you can take a final exam (2 hours): Friday, December 13, 0950-1150.</p>
<p>You can have a standard note sheet: 8.5x11 inches, handwritten, two-sided. You do not need to submit it after the exam. Calculators are allowed. 
There are 5 problems for midterms and 10 problems for the final. These problems will be similar to homework assignments and quizzes. 
Before each midterm and the final, practice exams and additional office hours will be available.</p>
<h3>Grading Scheme</h3>
<p>You are allowed to drop the lowest homework. Each homework is worth 3%, each midterm is 16%, and the final exam is worth 25%. Combined, 
they give you your total score.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This class is not a competitive environment. I wish every one of you succeeds. Therefore, your grade depends on your own total score, calculated as above.
 As an example, getting your total score above 90% guarantees you an A, regardless of what the rest of the class did. 
Relative comparison of students (``the curve'') will be used to push grades up, not down.</p>
<ul>
<li>A: top 10% of class or total score above 90%</li>
<li>A-: next 10% or total score above 85%</li>
<li>B+: next 10% or total score above 80%</li>
<li>B: next 10% or total score above 75%</li>
<li>B-: next 10% or total score above 70%</li>
<li>C+: total score above 65%</li>
<li>C: total score above 60%</li>
<li>C-: total score above 55%</li>
<li>D: total score above 50%</li>
<li>F: total score below 50%</li>
</ul>
<h3>Make-Up Work</h3>
<p>For religious holidays, exceptional family events, participation in University-sponsored activities, scientific conferences, 
athletic, or other similar events, arrangements must be made at least 3 days in advance. 
You will be required to provide documentation for your absence. Then we can arrange for the make-up exam or homework deadline extension.</p>
<h3>Recommendation Letters</h3>
<p>If you are applying to Master, PhD, or other graduate programs, and if you got an A or A- in this class, I can write you a recommendation letter. 
I can also proofread your statement and CV. Please send me your photo, CV, statement, and a list of schools your are applying to, 
together with exact names of programs, and application deadlines. If you wish to get recommendation letter for a non-academic job, 
it is enough to get a C or above.</p>
<h3>Requests and Complaints</h3>
<p>Please do not hesitate to speak with the professor directly. If this did not resolve the issue, 
please speak to the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.unr.edu/math/people/tin-yau-tam">Department Chair Tin Yau Tam</a><span>&nbsp;</span>or
<a href="https://www.unr.edu/math/student-resources/academic-advising">Undergraduate Advisors.</a></p>
<h3>Academic Success Services</h3>
<p>Your student fees cover usage of the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.unr.edu/math-center">University Math Center</a><span>&nbsp;</span>
