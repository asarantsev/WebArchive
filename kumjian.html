<p><strong>Welome to Analysis!</strong> This is the first course of a two semester sequence which lays the foundation of the theory that makes Calculus work. The primary emphasis is the theory of functions of one variable. Much of the work involves writing proofs. The key to success is the hard work needed to grasp the concepts well enough to work with them in the formulation of logical written argument; computation will play a secondary role unlike many other math courses. You are strongly encouraged to read the text carefully, for it is well written and full of good examples. But it is not enough to read the text. In order to truly master the material, you will need to work with it. Homework will therefore constitute a critical part of the course.</p>
<p>We will cover the following chapters of the text:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Real Numbers</p></li>
<li><p>Sequences</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous Functions</p></li>
<li><p>The Derivative</p></li>
<li><p>The Integral</p></li>
</ol>
