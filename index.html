<h3> Message to prospective MS/PhD students in Mathematics and Statistics</h3>

<p> Thank you for your interest in applying for a graduate program in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Nevada, Reno. We do need strong and qualified graduate students. Admission decisions are made by a committee of professors. 
      An individual professor cannot make such decision. The correct way to apply is go to <a href = "https://www.unr.edu/grad/admissions/how-to-apply">this web site</a> and follow the instructions. Admission deadline for Fall 2024 with financial support is February 1. 
      After this date, a decision on whether to accept or reject your application will be made by a committee. Financial support will most likely include Teaching Assistantship, tuition waiver (free tuition), and health insurance. 
      Emailing me and attaching your CV/Statement/Resume will not increase your chances of admission. Do not ask me questions about admission which can be answered by looking at the University web site -- this is disrespectful. 
  Currently, I do not have any grants or other forms of financial support for you. I cannot give Research Assistantships to students.   Usually a MS student chooses an adviser in the second year, and a PhD student in the second or third year of studies. Before that, students take classes required by this program.

<p> Starting from July 2018, I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the 
<a href = "http://www.unr.edu/math/"> Department of Mathematics and Statistics,</a> 
<a href = "http://www.unr.edu/"> University of Nevada, Reno.</a> 
Research interests: Probability Theory, Statistics and Data Analysis, Stochastic Analysis, Stochastic Finance. 
</p>
<p> 
From Autumn 2015 to Summer 2018, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at the 
<a href = "http://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/"> Department of Statistics and Applied Probability,</a>
<a href = "http://www.ucsb.edu/"> University of California, Santa Barbara.</a> 
My postdoctoral mentor was <a href="http://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/faculty/fouque/">Jean-Pierre Fouque,</a> 
who partially supported me with his NSF grant DMS 1409434.
</p>
<p> I got my Ph.D. in June 2015 from the <a href = "http://www.math.washington.edu"> Department of Mathematics,</a>
