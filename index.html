<p> I am an Associate Professor (with tenure, starting from July 2024) at the 
<a href = "http://www.unr.edu/math/"> Department of Mathematics and Statistics,</a> 
<a href = "http://www.unr.edu/"> University of Nevada, Reno.</a> 
I worked as a tenure-track Assistant Professor here starting from July 2018. <strong> Research interests:</strong> Statistical Theory, Time Series Analysis, Stochastic Processes, Stochastic Analysis, Quantitative Finance, Financial Econometrics. 
</p>
    
<p> 
From Autumn 2015 to Summer 2018, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at the 
<a href = "http://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/"> Department of Statistics and Applied Probability,</a>
<a href = "http://www.ucsb.edu/"> University of California, Santa Barbara.</a> 
My postdoctoral mentor was <a href="http://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/faculty/fouque/">Jean-Pierre Fouque,</a> 
who partially supported me with his NSF grant DMS 1409434.
I got my Ph.D. in June 2015 from the <a href = "http://www.math.washington.edu"> Department of Mathematics,</a>
<a href = "http://www.washington.edu"> University of Washington, Seattle,</a> 
under the supervision of <a href="http://www.math.washington.edu/~soumik/"> 
Soumik Pal.</a>

<h3> Message to prospective MS/PhD students in Mathematics and Statistics</h3>

<p> Thank you for your interest in applying to the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Nevada, Reno. 
We do need strong and qualified graduate students.
Financial support will most likely include Teaching Assistantship, tuition waiver (free tuition), and health insurance. 
Currently, I do not have any grants, scholarships, or other forms of financial support for you. 
Therefore, I cannot give Research Assistantships to students. 
</p>
