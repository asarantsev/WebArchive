<h3>Student Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p><span>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Construct and mathematically analyze basic time series models (white noise, random walk, moving average), apply the time domain 
  (SARIMA, GARCH) and spectral domain (Fourier analysis, spectral filtering) modeling and verification to a given time series.</span></li>
<li><span>Perform second-order forecasting and forecast quality assessment for a given time series.</span></li>
  <li><span>Implement essential time series analyses in a professional </span> statistical package, perform independent time series analysis projects, 
    write project reports and present the results to a professional audience, and Independently build time series 
    analysis proficiency using professional literature.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>Topics Covered</h3>
<p>&bull; Descriptive techniques<br />
  &bull; Stochastic processes, stationarity, simple time-series models<br /> 
  &bull; Time domain methods (ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, Box-Jenkins approach, GARCH)<br />&bull; Forecasting<br />&bull; Frequency domain methods, spectral analysis</p>
<p>We will use Python or R, depedning on your choice.
<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>
<p>There are 13 homework assignments due on Tuesdays 23:00. Each includes math and most contain coding. Submission is online, via Web Campus. 
  You can scan or take a photo of your work and upload it on Web Campus. Alternatively, you can type it in Word or LaTeX. 
  This homework will be posted to Web Campus at least a week in advance, and graded by a homework grader inside Web Campus. 
  In addition, there is an Extra Credit assignment due Tuesday after Thanksgiving, December 1, 23:00.</p>
<h3>Exams</h3>
<p>There are no midterms. There is an (optional) final exam, you can take it if you are not satisfied with your class grade before the final. 
  It will take place on Wednesday, December 16, 07:30-09:30. 
  You can have a standard note sheet: 8.5x11 inches, handwritten, two-sided. You do not need to submit it after the exam. Calculators are allowed. 
  There are 10 problems, similar to homework assignments. Practice exams and additional office hours will be available. 
<h3>Grading Scheme</h3>
<p>You are allowed to drop the lowest homework. Each homework is worth 6.5%, extra credit is worth 7%, and the final exam is worth 22%. 
  This class is not a competitive environment. I wish every one of you succeeds. Therefore, your grade depends on your own total score, calculated as above. 
  As an example, getting your total score above 90% guarantees you an A, regardless of what the rest of the class did. Relative comparison of students 
  <i>the curve</i> will be used to push grades up, not down.</p>
<ul>
<li>A: top 10% of class or total score above 90%</li>
<li>A-: next 10% or total score above 86%</li>
<li>B+: next 10% or total score above 82%</li>
<li>B: next 10% or total score above 78%</li>
<li>B-: next 10% or total score above 74%</li>
<li>C+: total score above 70%</li>
<li>C: total score above 65%</li>
<li>C-: total score above 60%</li>
<li>D: total score above 50%</li>
<li>F: total score below 50%</li>
</ul>
<h3>Make-Up Work</h3>
<p>For religious holidays, exceptional family events, participation in University-sponsored activities, scientific conferences, 
  athletic, or other similar events, arrangements must be made at least 3 days in advance. You will be required to provide documentation for your absence. 
  Then we can arrange for the make-up exam or homework deadline extension.</p>
<h3>Recommendation Letters</h3>
<p>If you are applying to Master, PhD, or other graduate programs, and if you got an A or A- in this class, I can write you a recommendation letter. 
  I can also proofread your statement and CV. Please send me your photo, CV, statement, and a list of schools your are applying to, 
  together with exact names of programs, and application deadlines. If you wish to get recommendation letter for a non-academic job, 
  it is enough to get a C or above.</p>
