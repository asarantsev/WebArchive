<p><strong>Instructor:</strong> <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://asarantsev.github.io/WebArchive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrey Sarantsev</a></p>
<p><strong>Office:</strong> DMSC 234</p>
<p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:asarantsev@unr.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asarantsev@unr.edu</a></p>
<p><strong>Classroom:</strong> William Raggio Building (WRB) 2009</p>
<p><strong>Date &amp; Time:</strong> MW 14:30-15:45</p>
<p><strong>Office Hours: </strong>MTW 10:00-12:00, T 13:00-15:00, or by appointment</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong><span>MATH 330 (Matrix Algebra) and STAT 4/661 (Probability Theory) with a C or better</span></p>
  <p><strong> Disclaimer:</strong> This class relies heavily on STAT 461/661: Probability Theory. 
    It is a student's responsibility to know this content of STAT 461/661. 
    The fact that a student has taken Probability Theory a long time ago is not considered an excuse. 
    We will review Probability Theory during the first lecture. 
    If a student finds out that some Probability Theory content is challenging, the student can come to my office hours 
    and I can suggest some review content. It is the student's responsibility to undertake this review. 
    In lectures after the first lecture, I will assume by default you know all STAT 461/661 content. 
    A student who struggles with Probability Theory will certainly struggle and likely fail STAT 753. 
    We will also review Matrix Algebra (matrix multiplication and eigenvalues) during the first lecture. It is essential for this class too. </p>
<p><strong>Textbook:&nbsp;</strong>We use the professor's <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://asarantsev.github.io/WebArchive/notes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lecture notes</a>, sections 11-19. Optional (not mandatory) textbooks:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><i><a class="inline_disabled external" href="http://probability.ca/jeff/spbook.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>A First Look at Stochastic Processes,</span></a></i><span>&nbsp;Jeffrey Rosenthal</span></li>
    <li><em>Stochastic Processes</em><span>, Emanuel Parzen</span></li>
    <li><span><em>Probability Models</em>, Sheldon Ross</span></li>
 </ul>
  Also see a <a href = "https://www.deenaschmidt.com/Teaching/Sp20/Stat753/"> Useful Course Web Page by Professor Deena Schmidt</a>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> <span>Stochastic processes models with applications. Analytic and computer modeling techniques for Markov chains, Poisson processes, Markov processes, empirical processes, Brownian motion, and special topics.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Coding:</strong> We will use Python. You do not need any preliminary knowledge of Python. We will cover everything in class. We will use numpy, scipy, matplotlib libraries. A Python integrated development environment (IDE) is recommended: PyCharm, Spyder, Jupiter, Thonny. (An example of an IDE is RStudio for R.)</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Homework: </strong>Each homework will contain a mix of theoretical and programming problems. There are 11 homework assignments, each due Wednesday 17:00, submitted by Web Campus.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Exams: </strong>There is one midterm right before the Spring Break, Wednesday, March 20. You can use a calculator (any model) and a two-sided handwritten letter-sized note sheet. The midterm contains no programming problems. There is also one final exam on Monday, May 13, 15:00-17:00. The final exam will include presentations of individual projects.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Grading:</strong> You can drop the lowest homework. Each homework is 4%, midterm is 20%, final project is 36%. Class grade: A 93%, A- 90%, B+ 85%, B 80%, C 75%, D 67%, F otherwise. The score is NOT rounded.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Recommendation Letters:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span>If you receive an A or A-, I can write you a strong and supportive letter of recommendation to a graduate or professional program of your choice. For such a letter to an industry job or internship (that is, outside a university or college), you must receive a C or above.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Academic Success Services:&nbsp;</strong>Your student fees cover usage of the&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://www.unr.edu/math-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University Math Center&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;(775) 784-4433,&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://www.unr.edu/tutoring-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University Tutoring Center&nbsp;</a>(775) 784-6801,&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://www.unr.edu/writing-speaking-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University Writing Center</a>&nbsp;(775) 784-6030.
