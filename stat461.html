<a href = "./notes.pdf"> Lecture Notes</a> (sections 1-10)</p>
<h3>Student Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>demonstrate understanding of randomness</li>
<li>use probability models to explain simple random phenomena</li>
<li>compute summaries of probability distributions (univariate and multivariate)</li>
<li>compute measures of location, dispersion, and association</li>
<li>find probability of interest for many univariate and multivariate distributions</li>
<li>assess asymptotic results provided by the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem</li>
<li>use them for estimates of quantities from data</li>
</ul>
<h3>Syllabus</h3>
<p>Experiments, counting techniques, probability axioms; random variables, expectation, univariate and multivariate distribution theory, measures of association, moment generating functions, marginal and conditional probabilities, cumulative distribution functions, Bayes theorem, sequences of random variables, Chebyshev's inequality, Law of Large Numbers, and Central Limit Theorem.</p>
<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>
<p>There are 10 homework assignments due on Wednesdays 2300. Submission is online, via Web Campus. You can scan or take a photo of your work and upload it on Web Campus. Alternatively, you can type it in Word or LaTeX. This homework will be posted to Web Campus at least a week in advance, and graded by a homework grader inside Web Campus.</p>
<h3>Exams</h3>
<p>There are 3 midterms, each on Friday lecture:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Midterm 1: September 27</li>
<li>Midterm 2: November 1</li>
<li>Midterm 3: December 6</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not satisfied with your overall grade, you can take a final exam (2 hours): Friday, December 13, 1210-1410.</p>
<p>You can have a standard note sheet: 8.5x11 inches, handwritten, two-sided. You do not need to submit it after the exam. Calculators are allowed. There are 5 problems for midterms and 10 problems for the final. These problems will be similar to homework assignments and quizzes. Before each midterm and the final, practice exams and additional office hours will be available.</p>
<h3>Grading Scheme</h3>
<p>You are allowed to drop the lowest homework. Each homework is worth 3%, each midterm is 16%, and the final exam is worth 25%. Combined, they give you your total score.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This class is not a competitive environment. I wish every one of you succeeds. Therefore, your grade depends on your own total score, calculated as above. As an example, getting your total score above 90% guarantees you an A, regardless of what the rest of the class did. Relative comparison of students (``the curve'') will be used to push grades up, not down.</p>
<ul>
<li>A: top 10% of class or total score above 90%</li>
<li>A-: next 10% or total score above 85%</li>
<li>B+: next 10% or total score above 80%</li>
<li>B: next 10% or total score above 75%</li>
<li>B-: next 10% or total score above 70%</li>
<li>C+: total score above 65%</li>
<li>C: total score above 60%</li>
<li>C-: total score above 55%</li>
<li>D: total score above 50%</li>
<li>F: total score below 50%</li>
</ul>
<h3>Make-Up Work</h3>
<p>For religious holidays, exceptional family events, participation in University-sponsored activities, scientific conferences, athletic, or other similar events, arrangements must be made at least 3 days in advance. You will be required to provide documentation for your absence. Then we can arrange for the make-up exam or homework deadline extension.</p>
<h3>Recommendation Letters</h3>
<p>If you are applying to Master, PhD, or other graduate programs, and if you got an A or A- in this class, I can write you a recommendation letter. I can also proofread your statement and CV. Please send me your photo, CV, statement, and a list of schools your are applying to, together with exact names of programs, and application deadlines. If you wish to get recommendation letter for a non-academic job, it is enough to get a C or above.</p>
<h3>Requests and Complaints</h3>
<p>Please do not hesitate to speak with the professor directly. If this did not resolve the issue, please speak to the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.unr.edu/math/people/tin-yau-tam">Department Chair Tin Yau Tam</a><span>&nbsp;</span>or

These centers support your classroom learning; it is your responsibility to take advantage of their services. Keep in mind that seeking help outside of class is the sign of a responsible and successful student.</p>
<h3>Academic Dishonesty</h3>
<p>The University Academic Standards Policy defines academic dishonesty, and mandates specific sanctions for violations. See the University Academic Standards Policy<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.unr.edu/student-conduct/policies/university-policies-and-guidelines/academic-standards/academic-standards-policy-for-students">University Academic Standards Policy 6502.</a></p>
<h3>Disability and Accessibility</h3>
<p>Any student with a disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak with<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.unr.edu/drc">Disability Resource Center</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(Pennington Student Achievement Center, Suite 230) as soon as possible to arrange for appropriate accommodations. This course may leverage 3rd party web/multimedia content. If you experience issues accessing this content, please notify me.</p>
