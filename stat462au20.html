<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p><span>Emanuel Parzen,&nbsp;<em>Stochastic Processes</em> (2015). </span>You might also find useful my<span> Lecture Notes: [<a href="https://asarantsev.github.io/WebArchive/notes.pdf">PDF</a>] (not accessible) or accessible R Markdown versions:&nbsp;</span><span>[<a href="https://asarantsev.github.io/WebArchive/notes1.html">Part 1: Sections 1-10 Probability Theory</a>]&nbsp;</span><span>[<a href="https://asarantsev.github.io/WebArchive/notes2.html">Part 2: Sections 11-20 Stochastic Processes</a>]&nbsp;</span><span>[<a href="https://asarantsev.github.io/WebArchive/notes3.html">Part 3: Simulations</a>]</span></p>
<h3>Student Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Demonstrate understanding of the probability foundations for stochastic processes through proofs and examples.</span></li>
<li><span>Build and use stochastic processes, including random walks, Markov chains, branching processes, Poisson and renewal processes.</span></li>
<li><span>Build and use continuous time stochastic process to model real-world phenomena.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Topics Covered</h3>
<p><span>Discrete and continuous time stochastic processes with applications to physics, biology, actuarial science, and quantitative finance. 
Topics include: discrete- and continuous-time Markov chains, random walk, simple autoregression, branching processes, 
Poisson process, birth-and-death processes, renewal processes, </span><span>Brownian motion and stochastic calculus.&nbsp;</span>
<span>We will use R for simple simulation problems: <a href="https://www.pauljhurtado.com/R/">Professor Paul Hurtado's R resources.</a></span></p>
<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>
<p>There are 13 homework assignments due on Tuesdays 23:00. Each includes math and most contain coding. Submission is online, via Web Campus. 
You can scan or take a photo of your work and upload it on Web Campus. Alternatively, you can type it in Word or LaTeX. 
This homework will be posted to Web Campus at least a week in advance, and graded by a homework grader inside Web Campus. 
In addition, there is an Extra Credit assignment due Tuesday after Thanksgiving, December 1, 23:00.</p>
<h3>Exams</h3>
<p>There are no midterms. There is an (optional) final exam, you can take it if you are not satisfied with your class grade before the final. 
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">You can have a standard note sheet: 8.5x11 inches, handwritten, two-sided. 
You do not need to submit it after the exam. Calculators are allowed. There are 10 problems, similar to homework assignments. 
Practice exams and additional office hours will be available. The Proctorio software will be used.</span></p>
<h3>Grading Scheme</h3>
<p>You are allowed to drop the lowest homework. Each homework is worth 6.5%, extra credit is worth 7%, and the final exam is worth 22%. 
This class is not a competitive environment. I wish every one of you succeeds. Therefore, your grade depends on your own total score, calculated as above. 
As an example, getting your total score above 90% guarantees you an A, regardless of what the rest of the class did. 
Relative comparison of students, <i>the curve</i> will be used to push grades up, not down.</p>
<ul>
<li>A: top 10% of class or total score above 90%</li>
<li>A-: next 10% or total score above 86%</li>
<li>B+: next 10% or total score above 82%</li>
<li>B: next 10% or total score above 78%</li>
<li>B-: next 10% or total score above 74%</li>
<li>C+: total score above 70%</li>
<li>C: total score above 65%</li>
<li>C-: total score above 60%</li>
<li>D: total score above 50%</li>
<li>F: total score below 50%</li>
</ul>
