<h3>Student Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Demonstrate understanding of the probability foundations for stochastic processes through proofs and examples.</span></li>
<li><span>Build and use stochastic processes, including random walks, Markov chains, branching processes, Poisson and renewal processes.</span></li>
<li><span>Implement code in R or Python for real-world problems.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Topics Covered</h3>
<p><span>Discrete and continuous time stochastic processes with applications to physics, biology, actuarial science, and quantitative finance. 
Topics include: discrete- and continuous-time Markov chains, random walk, simple autoregression, branching processes, 
Poisson process, birth-and-death processes, renewal processes, </span><span>Brownian motion and stochastic calculus.&nbsp;</span>
<span>We will use R for simple simulation problems: <a href="https://www.pauljhurtado.com/R/">Professor Paul Hurtado's R resources.</a></span></p>
<h3>Homework Assignments</h3>
<p>There are 13 homework assignments due on Tuesdays 23:00, starting from September 1. Each includes theory and coding. Submission is online, via Web Campus. 
For theoretical problems, you can scan or take a photo of your work and upload it on Web Campus. Alternatively, you can type it in Word or LaTeX. 
For coding problems, you can submit the code and output (graphs or numbers). 
Each homework will be posted to Web Campus at least a week in advance, and graded by a homework grader inside Web Campus. 
In addition, there is an Extra Credit assignment due Tuesday after Thanksgiving, December 1, 23:00.</p>
<h3>Exams</h3>
<p>There are no midterms. 
There is an (optional) final take-home 24-hour exam, you can take it if you are not satisfied with your class grade before the final. 
 You can use any books, lecture notes, or online content, but not contact any other people, except me.  
 There are 10 problems, similar to homework assignments. 
Practice exams and additional office hours will be available. </p>
<h3>Grading Scheme</h3>
<p>You are allowed to drop the lowest homework. Each homework is worth 6.5%, extra credit is worth 7%, and the final exam is worth 22%. 
This class is not a competitive environment. I wish every one of you succeeds. Therefore, your grade depends on your own total score, calculated as above. 
As an example, getting your total score above 90% guarantees you an A, regardless of what the rest of the class did. 
Relative comparison of students, <i>the curve</i> will be used to push grades up, not down.</p>
<ul>
<li>A: top 10% of class or total score above 90%</li>
<li>A-: next 10% or total score above 86%</li>
<li>B+: next 10% or total score above 82%</li>
<li>B: next 10% or total score above 78%</li>
<li>B-: next 10% or total score above 74%</li>
<li>C+: total score above 70%</li>
<li>C: total score above 65%</li>
<li>C-: total score above 60%</li>
<li>D: total score above 50%</li>
<li>F: total score below 50%</li>
</ul>
 <h3>Make-Up Work</h3>
<p>For religious holidays, exceptional family events, participation in University-sponsored activities, scientific conferences, 
  athletic, or other similar events, arrangements must be made at least 3 days in advance. You will be required to provide documentation for your absence. 
  Then we can arrange for the make-up exam or homework deadline extension.</p>
<h3>Recommendation Letters</h3>
<p>If you are applying to Master, PhD, or other graduate programs, and if you got an A or A- in this class, I can write you a recommendation letter. 
  I can also proofread your statement and CV. Please send me your photo, CV, statement, and a list of schools your are applying to, 
  together with exact names of programs, and application deadlines. If you wish to get recommendation letter for a non-academic job, it is enough to get a C or above.</p>
